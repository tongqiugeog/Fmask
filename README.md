# Fmask
The software called Fmask (Function of mask) is used for automated **clouds**, **cloud shadows**, **snow**, and **water** masking for Landsats 4-8 and Sentinel 2 images.

If you have any questions, please contact Zhe Zhu (zhe@uconn.edu) and Shi Qiu (shi.qiu@uconn.edu) at Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Connecticut.

**IMPORTANT:**

This Github page **ONLY** includes the Matlab code for Fmask 4.2. **The Matlab package with GLOBAL AUXILIARY DATA (~1G)** is available at this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bVwvlGDFOsWnVj5b3MqI5yqRDoi8g935?usp=sharing), where **autoFmask** is the main function for processing an image. **autoFmaskBacth** can process all Landsats 4-8 and Sentinel-2 images into a folder. Note that Mapping Toolbox in Matlab is required for using the source Code.

**Fmask 4.2 softwares** (including standalones with GUI and without GUI) on Windows, Mac, and Linux (~1G without MCR and ~3G with MCR) are also ready to use now! It can be downloaded at this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bVwvlGDFOsWnVj5b3MqI5yqRDoi8g935?usp=sharing).

This 4.1 version has substantial better cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection results for Sentinel 2 and better results (compared to the 3.3 version that is currently being used by USGS as the Collection 1 QA Band) for Landsats 4-8 . This one software can be used for **Landsats 4-8 Collection 1 (or Collection 2) Level 1 product (Digital Numbers)** and **Sentinel 2 Level-1C product (Top Of Atmosphere reflectance)** at the same time.


**IMPORTANT:** Majority of the current Collection 1 Landsats 4-8 QA Band provided by USGS are derived form **3.3 Version of Fmask algorithm** based on default parameters (cloud probability is 22.5% and buffer pixel size is 3). For example, (1) The Cloud (bit 4) is based on Fmask cloud mask (0 is not cloud and 1 is cloud in Fmask); (2) The Cloud Confidence (bits 5-6) is based on Fmask cloud probability in which >22.5% is high (11), >12.5% is medium (10), and <12.5% is low (01) with 00 kept for future use; (3) Snow/ice Confidence (bits 9-10) and Cloud Shadow Confidence (bits 7-8) has only low confidence (01) and high confidence (11) which correspond to no and yes respectively in snow/ice and cloud shadow mask provided by Fmask.

**IMPORTANT:** When making the accuracy assessment for Fmask, please dilate 3 pixels for cloud shadow, but no dilation for cloud, snow, and water.


# 4.2 Version
1) Update Fmask tool for processing Landsat Collection 2 data; and allow the cloud probability thershold in a larger range such as [-100, 100] in the GUI version. (Shi Qiu 4/8/2020)

----- 4.1 version below ---- (4.1 version can be download at this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l84t_lbp5Cp5v8L_Rbzk3WQHap7MdFwc) for Matlab code and this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oVefP9G-TD2vhoCaaKCxQjvAnUlrwB19?usp=sharing) for standalones)

2) The cloud shadow mask over water would not be provided at default settings since this will be less meaningful to use and very time-consuming to process. At the same time, fixed the bug that the auxiliary data may not be used for some Sentinel-2 images, of which the extent in the metadata is defined in [0 360] rather than [-180 180]. (Shi Qiu 3/17/2020)

----- 4.0 version below ---- (4.0 version can be download at this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SXBnEBDJ1Kbv7IQ9qIgqloYHZfdP6O1O))

3) Fixed the bug that the cloud shadows in Sentinel-2 imagery would be projected along a wrong direction when solar azimuth angle > 180 degrees. (Shi Qiu 01/19/2019)

4) Integrated Cloud Displacement Index (CDI) into this Fmask 4.0 for better seperating clouds from bright surfaces especail for Sentinel-2. The CDI was specially designed to separate clouds from bright surfaces based on the view angle parallax of the three near infrared bands (band 7, 8 and 8a) ([Frantz et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.046)).  (Shi Qiu and Zhe Zhu 06/03/2018)

5) Revised the method to identify the potential false positive cloud pixels.  (Shi Qiu and Zhe Zhu 05/23/2018)

6) Restricted the height of the clouds located in the scene boundary into the predicted cloud height derived from its neighboring clouds.  (Shi Qiu 04/05/2018)

7) Removed the overlap between the predicted cloud shadow and the potential cloud shadow layer for cloud shadow detection. (Shi Qiu and Zhe Zhu 03/29/2018)

8) Fixed the bug that the reading blue band using GRIDobj may lead to Nan value for Landsat images. (Shi Qiu 03/26/2018)

9) Improved the computational efficiency specially for cloud shadow matching procedure.  (Zhe Zhu and Shi Qiu 03/24/2018)

10) Released Fmask 4.0 beta version. (Shi Qiu, Zhe Zhu, and Binbin He 03/22/2018)

1. Download the Matlab code for Fmask 3.2 version by this link and unzip the Fmask folder.

2. Use "addpath" in Matlab environment for the Fmask folder.

3. Type "autoFmask" in the command window.

**Linux Executable**
Stand alone Linux executable Fmask software which do not need to install Matlab or R and runs on Linux 64 bits machine with 4G+ memory. It is based on the same Fmask 3.2sav Matlab code and it can be download and used by the following steps:

1. Download Fmask 3.2 version Linux package "Fmask_pkg.zip" Use any Brosweer and go to the following [ftp sites]: (http://ftp-earth.bu.edu/public/zhuzhe/Fmask_Linux_3.2v/)

2. Unzip the software using "unzip Fmask_pkg.zip"

3. There will be a new file called MCRInstaller.zip at the same folder and unzip this file.

4. Install MCRInstaller by typing "./install" in the same folder

5. There will be wizard that help you install and there will be two environment variables called "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" and "XAPPLRESDIR" showed up in the wizard. Copy the two variables.

For example, This is what I got:

"On the target computer, append the following to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

/home/amd64

Next, set the XAPPLRESDIR environment variable to the following value:

/home/app-defaults"

6. Edit your .cshrc (.tcsh is the same, for .bash replace it with export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="...") file and add this

"setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/amd64"

"setenv XAPPLRESDIR /home/app-defaults"

7. Save the shell or bash script and source it;

8. Copy the "Fmask" software to any location you want (for example "/Tools/Fmask");

9. cd into the folder where Landsat bands and .MTL files downloaded and run Fmask by entering "/Tools/Fmask" in the terminals.

There are four important tuning variables that you can play with:

1) "cldpix" is dilated number of pixels for cloud with default values of 3.

2) "sdpix" is dilated number of pixels for cloud shadow with default values of 3.

3) "snpix" is dilated number of pixels for snow with default values of 0.

4) "cldprob" is the cloud probability threshold with default values of 22.5 (range from 0~100). If you want to use default values "/Tools/Fmask" is enough, if you want to customize your own parameters, you can use "/Tools/Fmask cldpix sdpix snpix cldprob", for example "/Tools/Fmask 3 3 0 22.5" in the terminals

Matlab
The Fmask 2.0sav software can only process the new Landsat metadata format downloaded after August 29, 2012. It includes the most recent updates since 1.6.3sav as follows:

# 1.6.3 Version
Matlab
The Fmask 1.6.3 & Fmask 1.6.3sav software can only process the old Landsat metadata format downloaded before August 29, 2012.

Two Matlab versions of Fmask: 1.6.3 Version need to use LEDAPS to prepare inputs for Fmask (works with WO.txt and MTL.txt header); 1.6.3 Stand Alone Version (sav) can be run in Matlab environment directly (works with MTL.txt header at the moment). The Fmask 1.6.3v and 1.6.3sav software are located at the "Downloads" tab and the help files are in the "Wiki" tab.

The Fmask1.6.3 version has been validated with the 142 Landsat reference scenes distributed in different continents and the overall accuracy has improved more than 0.06% (overall accuracy of 96.47%) since the 1.6.0 version explained in following paper.

R
There is also a R script translated from Matlab 1.6.3sav version (They will code the most recent Fmask algorithm soon) performed by Joseph Henry (joseph.henry@sydney.edu.au) and Willem Vervoort (willem.vervoort@sydney.edu.au) at Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Environment, The University of Sydney, Australia.
